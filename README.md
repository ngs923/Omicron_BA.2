# Omicron_BA.2

## SARS-CoV-2 genome dataset

SARS-CoV-2 genomes and annotation information used in this study were downloaded from the GISAID database (https://gisaid.org) as of February 26, 2022. 
In this study, 624 (349 Omicron and 275 non-Omicron) SARS-CoV-2 genomes were used, which is summarized in the following website: https://doi.org/10.55876/gis8.230110hk. 

## ggtree code
An R source code file (ggtree_Omicron_BA.2.R) is used for Figure 1A/1B and Supplementary Figure 1A - 1C. Note that a maximum-likelihood tree and GISAID metadata were not provided on the github considering [the GISAID EpiFluâ„¢ Database Access Agreement](https://gisaid.org/terms-of-use/).
